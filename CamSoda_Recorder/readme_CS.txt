Usage:

Populate the CS_Model.txt text file with the CamSoda models names (only lowercase, one model per line, ONLY the names).
Start Recorder_CS.cmd, choose model by index and hit Enter/Return. And repeat for all the models you want to record.

Useful informations:
- the time interval between attempts was calculated for an average PC/Laptop, for an average internet connection
and for 5..10 sessions. For other characteristics you may need to increase/decrease it.
- at the end of the Recorder_CS.cmd file you'll find a string looking like this "720p_alt,720p,best".
Here you can set the video quality of the recording. 720p and 1080p are preffered;
"best" automatically chooses the highest value but it isn't always preffered...
